# Cryptocurrencies

Use unsupervised Machine Learning techniques to analyze data on the cryptocurrencies traded on the market.


## Project Background

Present a report of what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how cryptocurrencies could be grouped toward creating a classification for developing a new investment product. Use unsupervised ML clustering algorithm to help determine cryptocurrencies groups.

## Project Objectives

- Prepare the data for dimensions reduction with PCA and clustering using K-means.

- Reduce data dimensions using PCA algorithms from sklearn.

- Predict clusters using cryptocurrencies data using the K-means algorithm form sklearn.

- Create some plots and data tables to present your results.

## Data Resources

- The cryptocurrencies data was retrieved from <https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/all/coinlist>

- The csv format data resource (/Resources/crypto_data.csv)
